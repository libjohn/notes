        - local data school was emersive.  five months.  face to face.  open to any staff
        - unix, regex, R , tidyverses, visualiztion ....
        - scaled the school:  sponsors,
        - results:  data school focus (10 weeks ; 2 days per week), centered around R 
        - alumni are putting reproducible techniques into practice
        - data school ignition (1 day; face-to-face) foundational skills
